# This is my attempt at building a Norwegian phonetic (phuzzy) encoder in the Aspell
# format. It is a work in progress, and I plan to tune it against my own writings in
# the next years.
#
# To learn the format I studied the Aspell manual and built a phonetic encoder in
# java. I used my own java based encoder to test the Norwegian ruleset, but I hope
# and trust that the phonetic encoder will work with the original Aspell program.
#
# Rune Kleveland's Norwegian ispell dictionaries have been used extensively while
# building this ruleset.
#
# The comments are in English, while terms and sounds are in Norwegian - the mix may
# be a little confusing.

#
# Loan words / exotic letters:
# ----------------------------
#
# I've not taken much care with loan words. It is hard, for example, to formulate rules
# for the CC in Franccois / Fibonacci / access / cappuccino. Fortunately we are not talking
# about many terms, here is a 'exotic letter count' from a typical Norwegian dictionary:
#
# C has 6097 entries.
# Q has 132 entries.
# W has 1105 entries.
# X has 434 entries.
# Z has 958 entries.
